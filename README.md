# CRICUT
A repository to house all the take home assignments for my CRICUT job interviews.

For the first project I chose to make the "CRICUT - WIZ-Bang Customer List" applicaition. It's a small Angular Application that allows you to maintain a list of Customers, with their E-Mail, Phone Number and Street Address. The search box at the top filters by all data cells on the list. Add a customer by simply clicking the + button on the top right. You can edit any cell on the list by simply clicking and editing the data. There is a delete button for each row of data. 

The settings tab allows you to import and export the list in csv or json format. You can also upload a .json list from somebody else. You will find 3 pre-generated lists in the project Data folder for testing. One is a blank list to start the list from scratch. The other contains 100 randomly generated test records.

The second project is the Cricut Orders Challenge. Which is a back end REST api implementation. Find the bug. Fix the bug. Which reveals a test that fails after the bug is fixed. Then add an additional end point to return orders from the data repository.  Pretty straight forward process. Tests to see if you understand the various layers of the application, Middleware to data access layer to thedatabase.

Wish me luck!
